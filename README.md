# NPX Ritik

![CLI Portfolio Demo](./demo.png)

## Overview

A CLI-first personal portfolio that runs right inside the terminal. Instead of a static website, this is a small utility that prints my profile directly in the shell

It is designed to live where developers already spend most of their time. The data is fetched dynamically at runtime, so things like my role, socials, and contact info are always up to date. Everything is shown in a clean, box-style layout that feels native to the terminal

## Usage

To check it out, just pop this into your terminal:

```bash
npx ritik
```
