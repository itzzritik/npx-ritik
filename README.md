# NPX Ritik

![CLI Portfolio Demo](./demo.png)

## Overview

A Node.js based CLI portfolio published as an npm package and executed via npx. Instead of serving static HTML, it runs as a command line utility that renders professional profile information directly in the terminal.

The tool fetches data dynamically at runtime, ensuring roles, social links, and contact details stay in sync with the source of truth. It is built to feel native to the shell, using a structured, box-style TUI layout that fits naturally into a developer’s workflow.

## Usage

To check it out, just pop this into your terminal:

```bash
npx ritik
```
