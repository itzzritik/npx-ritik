# NPX Ritik

![CLI Portfolio Demo](./demo.png)

## Overview

A CLI first approach to the personal portfolio, designed to live native in the terminal. Instead of serving static HTML, this tool operates as a dynamic utility that renders professional profile data directly in the shell.

It eliminates the friction of context switching by bringing the portfolio into the developer's primary workspace. Data is fetched dynamically at runtime, ensuring that role information, social presence, and contact details are always synchronized with the source of truth, presented in a clean, box-rendered interface.

## Usage

To check it out, just pop this into your terminal:

```bash
npx ritik
```
